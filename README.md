## Description
Chess is a beautifully simple game with a deceptively huge learning curve. Chess.com is my personal favourite
Chess website and thanks to it's very accessibly API I've endeavoured to create this tool to analyse my games
and better understand this wonderful game.

This is one of the first projects I've ever attempted and as such this code may be completely garbage. But, my goal is 
to use this project to motivate myself to be better at Chess, Python, and PostgreSQL.
